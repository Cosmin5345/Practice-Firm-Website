Project: Enterprise Fair Project – Company Presentation Website

Achievement: 3rd place at the Enterprise Fair

This is a presentation website created for our high school enterprise fair. The website showcases our company, its products, and services. It was displayed at our stand during the event, allowing visitors to explore our offerings online, view the menu, learn about our team, and understand what our company is about.

The goal of the website was to provide a digital experience for everyone interested in our company, making it easy to navigate, explore our products, and get to know our team.
